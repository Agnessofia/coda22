In this workshop I am going to discuss some strategies of Twitter text analysis. It was produced in order to assist colleagues who work in the area of Corpus Linguistics and Systemic Functional Linguistics, as a way to use R in their research. It is part of my CNPq-Funded project and seeks to make corpus tools and `R` accessible.

Please feel free to help in the codes and tutorial improvement. If you see any mistake or possibility for code rewriting, please let me know.

# Contents

This course covers some tools for corpus and discourse analysis using **R**'s language and packages. It is intended to be a hands-on introduction, so some important issues might be left behind due to lack of time.
