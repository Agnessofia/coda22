# Introduction

In this workshop [Marcelo Buzato](mailto:mbuzato@unicamp.br) and [I](mailto:rll307@unicamp.br) are going to discuss some strategies of Twitter text analysis. It was produced in order to assist colleagues who work in the area of Corpus Linguistics and Systemic Functional Linguistics, as a way to use R in their research. It is part of my CNPq-Funded project and seeks to make corpus tools and `R` accessible.

Please feel free to help in the codes and tutorial improvement. If you see any mistake or possibility for code rewriting, please let us know.

# Contents

This course covers some tools for corpus and discourse analysis using **R**'s language and packages. It is intended to be a hands-on introduction, so some important issues might be left behind due to lack of time.
